# Read: 11 - EJS
## Watch EJS tutorial from WalkThroughCode on YouTube, Videos 1-5
* EJS stands for Embedded Javascript
* EJS allows you to skip the app.js file and allow the index or whatever file you dictate to access the server.js directly
* EJS allows you to also enter js directly into the index file to iterate over objects using for loops, if/else statements etc
* basically this would allow you to access information from a database or API and directly insert that infromation on the html file without having to push it to an app.js file then to the index file.
* i'm unsure of the application of this or if this is used because of speed or anything.
