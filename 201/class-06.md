# Read: 06 - JS Object Literals; The DOM
## Chapter 3: “Object Literals”
* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”
* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
* You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
* From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.
* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
## Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
* What I found with this simple application was that because it was so easy to understand, the focus was taken off of the problem domain and put instead on the technology.
* By creating a familiar problem domain, I found that both the tasks of me teaching a new technology and the viewer learning that technology were much easier, because it is very difficult to learn more than one thing at once.
* Figure out what the major components of the picture are
Sort the pieces by color or component
Put together all the border pieces
Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created
* You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.
*  It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking you understand enough of the problem to get started coding it.
