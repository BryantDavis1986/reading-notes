# Readings: Policies
## Policy-based authorization in ASP.NET Core
* Underneath the covers, role-based authorization and claims-based authorization use a requirement, a requirement handler, and a pre-configured policy. These building blocks support the expression of authorization evaluations in code. The result is a richer, reusable, testable authorization structure.
* An authorization policy consists of one or more requirements. It's registered as part of the authorization service configuration, in the Startup.ConfigureServices method:
```
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddMvc().SetCompatibilityVersion(CompatibilityVersion.Version_2_2);

    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("AtLeast21", policy =>
            policy.Requirements.Add(new MinimumAgeRequirement(21)));
    });
}
```
* The primary service that determines if authorization is successful is IAuthorizationService:
 ```
 /// <summary>
/// Checks policy based permissions for a user
/// </summary>
public interface IAuthorizationService
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if a user meets a specific set of requirements for the specified resource
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="user">The user to evaluate the requirements against.</param>
    /// <param name="resource">
    /// An optional resource the policy should be checked with.
    /// If a resource is not required for policy evaluation you may pass null as the value
    /// </param>
    /// <param name="requirements">The requirements to evaluate.</param>
    /// <returns>
    /// A flag indicating whether authorization has succeeded.
    /// This value is <value>true</value> when the user fulfills the policy; 
    /// otherwise <value>false</value>.
    /// </returns>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Resource is an optional parameter and may be null. Please ensure that you check 
    /// it is not null before acting upon it.
    /// </remarks>`
    `Task<AuthorizationResult> AuthorizeAsync(ClaimsPrincipal user, object resource, 
                                     IEnumerable<IAuthorizationRequirement> requirements);
    /// <summary>
    /// Checks if a user meets a specific authorization policy
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="user">The user to check the policy against.</param>
    /// <param name="resource">
    /// An optional resource the policy should be checked with.
    /// If a resource is not required for policy evaluation you may pass null as the value
    /// </param>
    /// <param name="policyName">The name of the policy to check against a specific 
    /// context.</param>
    /// <returns>
    /// A flag indicating whether authorization has succeeded.
    /// Returns a flag indicating whether the user, and optional resource has fulfilled 
    /// the policy.    
    /// <value>true</value> when the policy has been fulfilled; 
    /// otherwise <value>false</value>.
    /// </returns>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Resource is an optional parameter and may be null. Please ensure that you check
    /// it is not null before acting upon it.
    /// </remarks>
    Task<AuthorizationResult> AuthorizeAsync(
                                ClaimsPrincipal user, object resource, string policyName);
}
```
* An authorization requirement is a collection of data parameters that a policy can use to evaluate the current user principal. In our "AtLeast21" policy, the requirement is a single parameterâ€”the minimum age. A requirement implements IAuthorizationRequirement, which is an empty marker interface. A parameterized minimum age requirement could be implemented as follows:  
`using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

public class MinimumAgeRequirement : IAuthorizationRequirement
{
    public int MinimumAge { get; }

    public MinimumAgeRequirement(int minimumAge)
    {
        MinimumAge = minimumAge;
    }
}`
* Note that the Handle method in the handler example returns no value. How is a status of either success or failure indicated?

A handler indicates success by calling context.Succeed(IAuthorizationRequirement requirement), passing the requirement that has been successfully validated.

A handler doesn't need to handle failures generally, as other handlers for the same requirement may succeed.

To guarantee failure, even if other requirement handlers succeed, call context.Fail.
* In cases where you want evaluation to be on an OR basis, implement multiple handlers for a single requirement. For example, Microsoft has doors which only open with key cards. If you leave your key card at home, the receptionist prints a temporary sticker and opens the door for you. In this scenario, you'd have a single requirement, BuildingEntry, but multiple handlers, each one examining a single requirement.
* There may be situations in which fulfilling a policy is simple to express in code. It's possible to supply a Func<AuthorizationHandlerContext, bool> when configuring your policy with the RequireAssertion policy builder.
* The HandleRequirementAsync method you implement in an authorization handler has two parameters: an AuthorizationHandlerContext and the TRequirement you are handling. Frameworks such as MVC or SignalR are free to add any object to the Resource property on the AuthorizationHandlerContext to pass extra information.
