# From the Duckett HTML book
## Introduction
- **Introduction** pages come at the beginning of each
chapter. They introduce the key topics you will learn
about.
- **Reference** pages introduce key pieces of HTML &
CSS code. The HTML code is shown in blue and CSS
code is shown in pink.
- **Background** pages appear on white; they explain the
context of the topics covered that are discussed in
each chapter
- **Diagram** and infographics pages are shown on a
dark background. They provide a simple, visual
reference to topics discussed.
- **Example** pages put together the topics you have
learned and demonstrate how they can be applied
in each.
- **Summary** pages come at the end of each chapter.
They remind you of the key topics that were covered
in each chapter.
## HTML Chapter 1: “Structure”
- HTML is the structure of the page
- HTML makes use of elements or tags to sort or management the information which gives each tag a special meaning. 
- HTML uses attributes within those tags/elements to give us more information about that tag.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
## HTML Chapter 8: “Extra Markup”
- DOCTYPES tells browsers which version of HTML you are using
- ID and Class attributes allow you to identify a particular tag or a group of tags to use CSS to style or format in a particular way
- You can add comments within your code either for yourself or other developers about a partifular code. This helps remind yourself of what you were doing in this particular situation.
## HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout”
- Older browsers do not understand HTML5 and require javascript to work properly.
- New elements were introduced to provide clearer code which replaced multiple div tags. They seperate different parts of the page or you could say indicate the different parts. 
## HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design”
- You must find your target audience, their demographics, why they're coming to their website and then design the page off of them.
- Once that is done and they do leave your website you must have answered their questions of why they visited in the first place.
- to better assist your visitors that visit your website. Visual hierchy helps address this as well as using color, size and style.
- Wireframes is like it sounds, the basic framework of how your page will look and setup.
## JS Chapter 1: “The ABC of Programming”
- Computers think differently than us, humans learn by being shown or told and will eventually not need those instructions anymore because we store that information and can recall it anytime we need it. Computers need to be told the instructions as many times as you need that particular task completed. It doesn't retain that information. So you must break it up into steps and think about all the different outcomes after it takes that step and write code for each of those.
- You must think of a goal before writing your code then evaluate all the different steps required before writing it.
- Javascript creates better functionality within the webpage.
- Javascript should be in a seperate file and the functions named. this will allow you to call upon each different function you wish to call upon within the html file.
